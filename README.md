## Building from scratch

**NOTE:** To build this app, you will need a Linux machine. The koxtoolchain fails to build on other platforms. You might be able to get it to build on MacOS, but it would probably be best to use a virtual machine instead.

Install [koxtoolchain]() and [Go](https://golang.org/), then run `make` to build the app.
